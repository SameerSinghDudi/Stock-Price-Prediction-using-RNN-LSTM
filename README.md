# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-RNN-LSTM
Accurately predict the next day's stock price based on the previous day's high and low price. 

Still a work in progress, I attempt to build a model using Long Short Term memory Recurrent Neural Network to predict the closing price of a particular stock.

I train the model on stock price data of Facebook and test it on Google. The graph at the end shows the accuracy of the model. 

## Next Steps
Test the model of various other stocks and attempt to build a trading strategy on the same. 
Use more features like Open price and volume in order to predict the closing price more accurately.
